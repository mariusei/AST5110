## Learning outcome
Completion of the course provides expertise in the following:

- discretization of simple hyperbolic PDE's such as the advection equation
- examination of the stability of difference equations using von Neummann stabilty analysis
- implicit and explicit numerical schemes and solution techniques for these
- multi-grid methods
- characteristic equations and boundary conditions based on these

- [Set 2: Set 2: Viscosity and staggered grid](http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/astro/AST5110/h14/undervisningsmateriale/exercise-numeric2.pdf "Set 2: Viscosity and staggered grid")

- [Set 3: Multigrid modelling exercise]("Multigrid modelling exercise")


### Multigrid motivation
*Different grid sizes have results converging at different scales to different structures*
