## Learning outcome
Completion of the course provides expertise in the following:

- discretization of simple hyperbolic PDE's such as the advection equation
- examination of the stability of difference equations using von Neummann stabilty analysis
- implicit and explicit numerical schemes and solution techniques for these
- multi-grid methods
- characteristic equations and boundary conditions based on these
